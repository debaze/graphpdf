# GraphPDF

*Graphic library for PDF templates. Supports pie charts, bar charts and line charts.*

### Overview

The library is built for JavaScript 1.7, because PDF templates doesn't always support the lastest JS version.  
All diagrams extend the `Diagram` superclass. This class should be only used through its subclasses.

### Diagrams
